# Hi-FIrst-Time
A First few nudges
I am 66+ ; did some work on computer science 
about 20 yrs back on NP-hard problems especially
on TSP and managed some research publications and
citations as lead author.
Now at my terminal period of life, I am planning to
revisit and relearn a few things about deep learning
with posssible applications on genetics using
topological group techniqes of pure mathematics - especially
in the area of protein folding.
Good day & God bless to every possible reader of this 
submission. 
THIS HOPEFULLY IS INSERTED IN THE BRANCH
